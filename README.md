# FarmYardDecorations

![BeeHarvestBarn](/Display/BeeHarvestBarn.png)

This small decorations pack was created for those who want to organise or decorate their yards or farm with blocks that could identify things from a distance.

### Minecraft Java ver: 1.16.5
### Forge ver: 36.2.0

## Contents:
* 7 Barn doors (3 blocks high x 2 blocks wide)
* 10 blocks of wood (6 vertical, 4 horizontal patterns)
* 50 image designs (5 for each block type/color)
* Potion/Flower/Honeycomb/Hoe/Torch (illumanties as strong as a regular torch)
* 1 Crafting table



## Lifecycle
This pack was designed for 1.16.5.  While I cannot *promise* that I will be regularly updating the pack for future or past versions,
EVERYTHING is uploaded on my [https://github.com/ChrisCraddock/FarmYardDecorations) page if you want to try and make it for
a different version.  As I get better with converting things to other versions of Minecraft, I may revisit this and post it. 

## Getting Started


### Crafting
1. Start by placing a vanilla crafting table inside the 3x3 crafting table grid, and recieve 1 new crafting grid with 43 output slots.
2.  To craft any decoration, just insert any of the vanilla wood planks into the top input slot on the left and select which pattern you would like
  2a. To craft the torch wood, insert a torch in the slot below the wood along with 1 piece of wood for those designs to show up.
3.  As long as there is wood left, switch between the designs and tap the button for how many of each you want.
  3a. Note: the wood option will match how many you put in, and not leave any left over.  If you want only want 14 of one design, only put 14 in. (working on trying to fix that)

### Known Issue:
1. Crafting wood planks with no design will match how many you put in, and not leave any left over. Tested many different logic combinations but all could be used to surpass amount put in.
